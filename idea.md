# Project Idea: ArchFolio — Architect Portfolio & Client Connect Platform

## What We're Building

ArchFolio is a web platform that bridges **architects** and **clients**. Architects can showcase their portfolio of projects, and clients can browse, discover, and directly contact architects whose work resonates with them. Each role has a dedicated dashboard tailored to their needs.

---

## Scope

The platform has two distinct user roles:

- **Architect** — A professional who registers, builds a profile, and posts project work (images, descriptions, categories, etc.)
- **Client** — A user who browses architect portfolios, saves favorites, and reaches out via a contact/inquiry system.

An **Admin** role manages the platform (approve/reject posts, manage users).
